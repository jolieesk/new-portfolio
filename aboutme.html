      <h3>My Story!</h3>
      My story starts off in an interesting way as I've been in the US for only 5 years! That's crazy to me when I think about it. It was really hard for me knowing that I had to start my life all over again with people I don't know. I never imagined
      how it was going to be like because I never accepted the fact that I was going to survive. The first year was the worst year for me as I just couldn't function what was going on at that time. As the years passed by it got a little better, it's
      still not the best if i'm going to be completely honest but it gets better everyday. I will never forget how my life used to be in Egypt and how happy I was but things change and I accepted it.

      <h3>My Journey</h3>
      I started coding by Sophommore year and now I am a Junior, I'm really proud of where I am right now.
      I can't wait to keep learning about code and finding out what I could do with it.
      I have always tried to create websites when I was a kid, from bussiness websites to watching videos on how to create new things on websites, and creating fonts.
      It was all in my mind but I didn't know where to start, thankfully after years and years of me just dreaming about coding this class got in my way. I applied to it thinking it could maybe help me start
      something I really like and have been looking forward too, and ever since I did I couldn't be happier about what I learned and what's about to come.
