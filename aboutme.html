        <h3>My Story!</h3>
        I moved to the US when I was almost 12 years old from Egypt, I didn't really like it here.
          I missed all my friends and family. I wanted to go back. I moved from Egypt to Bayonne for a month
          and then I came to marlboro and met a girl that's been my best friend for 4 years now. I couldn't be happier,
          ofcourse I miss Egypt, family, and friends more than anything but it isn't that bad anymore. I still can't wait for the day to go visit tho!

        <h3>My Journey</h3>
        I started coding by Sophommore year and now I am a Junior, I'm really proud of where I am right now.
        I can't wait to keep learning about code and finding out what I could do with it.
        I have always tried to create websites when I was a kid, from bussiness websites to watching videos on how to create new things on websites, and creating fonts.
        It was all in my mind but I didn't know where to start, thankfully after years and years of me just dreaming about coding this class got in my way. I applied to it thinking it could maybe help me start
        something I really like and have been looking forward too, and ever since I did I couldn't be happier about what I learned and what's about to come.
